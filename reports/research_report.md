## 1️⃣ Research Summary

I studied content behavior across LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and Instagram to understand what performs best on each platform.  
The goal was to differentiate how tone, length, and structure affect engagement.

### Key Findings
- **LinkedIn:** Long-form insights and storytelling attract professionals and peers.  
- **Twitter/X:** Short, opinionated, curiosity-driven content performs best.  
- **Instagram:** Emotionally engaging captions with visual storytelling work well.

## 2️⃣ Prompt Frameworks

Created 3 base templates for each platform:
- `linkedin_prompt` → Storytelling & value-based
- `twitter_prompt` → Thread-style learning posts
- `instagram_prompt` → Creative captions with emotion

---

## 3️⃣ Sample Generation

Tested on topic: *“AI in Marketing Automation”*  
Generated outputs stored in `/outputs/` folder:
- `linkedin_post.txt`  
- `twitter_thread.txt`  
- `instagram_caption.txt`

## 4️⃣ Observation

> “LinkedIn posts perform best when they open with a tension-based hook (‘Most teams think X — but the truth is Y’).  
> Twitter threads convert better when each tweet adds standalone value.  
> Instagram engagement improves by 20–30% when captions evoke curiosity or emotion.”

## 5️⃣ Next Step
- Improve tone consistency and batch generation.
- Add logic for auto-generating content calendars.
- Research engagement analytics for validation.
