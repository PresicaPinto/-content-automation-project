# Content Automation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building an **AI-driven multi-platform content generation framework** that adapts tone, structure, and length for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and Instagram.

The system is designed to **research, generate, and document** platform-specific content automatically — just like a professional content automation strategist.
